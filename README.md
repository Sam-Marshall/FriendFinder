#Friend Finder Application Built Using Node and Express Servers

###Overview

Following a quick 10 question survey, users are paired with another individual who is judged to be most compatible with them. The app will display the name and image of the user with the best overall match.

##App Walk Through

#Home Page

The home page of the app is very minimal and user friendly. You are presented with a site title and greeting, and have the options of clicking one of three links. The most prominent link is a button which will take you to the survey itself. The other two links are placed in the footer and will take you to either the GitHub repo where the code for the site lives or to an extension where you can look at the json output of the site users to date.

##Survey

The survey page of the app is also quite user friendly. There is a home button, if the you should so choose to go back to the home page. In the form itself there are two text input boxes to take in the your name and a link to a photo image. This is the information that will be stored and relayed to future users upon matching. Then you will answer 10 personality gauging questions before submitting the form. Once you hit submit your results will be tabulated and you will be presented with the name and image of your most compatible match from our pool of previous users.
